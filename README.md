I'm c-120, a student in junior high school.
Everyone can contact me by email if you have something to discuss with me. I'm happy to receive advices all the time.
As a student, I can't spend too much of my time on IT. I'm always busy with my school work.
I love playing Rythmn Games, such as Maimai,Acraea,Malody and phigros, and also racing games like Asphalt 9 and Forza Horizon series.
I'm currently learning Unity. If I have enough time, I also want to study Linux too.
Thank you.
