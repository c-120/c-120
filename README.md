- 👋 Hi, I’m @c-120
- 👀 I’m interested in physics, IT, art and so on. I'm also a developer, though I know little about Programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, C# ,JavaScripts, linux, unity and UnrealEngine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game making.
- 📫 You can write an email to c-120v@outlook.com to reach me.
- Please don't call me in any insulting nickname, that will damage a positive person, thank you.
- I don't know many things, so I have a long way to go in the future, maybe I can do better if you help me.
- Thank you.
